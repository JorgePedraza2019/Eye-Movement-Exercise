## Description of Project
The purpose of this project is to be able to follow the cursor through two components representing the movements of the eyes, this interactively using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

The improvements for the project will be to place a function that detects when the mouse touches any eye so that it blinks and thus achieve a much more dynamic effect.
